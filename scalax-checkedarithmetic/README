=== What's this? ===

This is a simple source distribution of an integral type checked arithmetic for scala 2.9.x

=== Version ===

version = 0.1



=== How to build ===

The most simple approach is to include the source file CheckedArithmetic.scala into your project
source scope and build it along with your project sources. The source file is self contained.

Or fork & build it and add the project as dependend project to your project in eclipse. 
This retains the ability to update via git.



=== Distribution ===

Because of it's (very) small size there is only this simple source distribution. Nothing else.



=== How to use ===

import de.bjos.scalax.checkedarithmetic.ReportExceptor
import de.bjos.scalax.checkedarithmetic.CheckedArithmetic

object <your calculation object> {

   private val checked = new CheckedArithmetic with ReportExceptor
   // or private val checked = new CheckedArithmetic{}

   import checked._   // bring the implicits in scope

   val a = 10 *? 1000
   val b = 100 -? 5 *? 5L
   val c = (5 +? 5) *? 20 /? 10 -? 3
   
}



=== Status ===

This is work in (slow) progress!
Be prepared for nasty bugs, sudden changes or silent removal.
